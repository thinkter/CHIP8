Chip8 is like this really old interpreter used in old computers in the 80s 


4KB of ram (4096 bytes) of from 0x000 to 0xFFF


first 512 bytes are used by are used by the interpreter 0x000 to 0x1FF


most chip8 programs should start at 0x200 

so all of our ram will be 0x200 to 0xFFF ( 512 to 4096)

dont know what a register is

chip8 has 16 8bit registers refered to as Vx where x is hexadecimal

theres some 16bit register called I apparently duno what that is

the program counter should be 16 bit
the stack pointer can be 8 bit its used to point the topmost lvl of the stack 

stack is an array of 16 16 bit values. chip8 allows for up to 16 levels of nested subroutines

we have a hexadecimal keypad as inputs form 0 to F
